<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Sridhana Murugan!</h1>


I’m a cybersecurity student and aspiring software engineer with a passion for **security, infrastructure, and backend development**.  

My approach is simple: **stay curious, build securely, and keep on learning**. I enjoy working with tools and frameworks that make technology **more reliable, scalable, and safe**.  

Outside of tech, you’ll probably find me **curled up with a mystery novel** or bingeing a new show.
