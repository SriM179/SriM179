<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sridhana Murugan</h1>


Iâ€™m a cybersecurity student and aspiring software engineer with a passion for **security, infrastructure, and backend development**.  

My approach is simple: **stay curious, build securely, and keep on learning**. I enjoy working with tools and frameworks that make technology **more reliable, scalable, and safe**.  

Outside of tech, youâ€™ll probably find me **curled up with a mystery novel**, practicing yoga, or experimenting with new vegetarian recipes.
